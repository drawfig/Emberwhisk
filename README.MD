## About Emberwhisk
Emberwhisk is a robust PHP and OpenSwoole framework designed to streamline the development of high-performance WebSocket applications. It's built on a simple philosophy: eliminate the tedious boilerplate so you can focus on your application's unique logic. With Emberwhisk, you can build powerful, real-time applications faster and with less effort.

Here's how we handle the heavy lifting:

- Connection and Lifecycle Management: Emberwhisk abstracts away the complexity of raw sockets, automatically managing connections from the initial handshake to graceful disconnections, while also providing the flexibility for manual control when needed.

- Message Routing and Event Dispatching: Our intuitive routing system allows you to effortlessly map incoming messages to the right application handler or service, making your codebase clean and organized.

- Built-in Error Handling: We provide a stable, opinionated system for catching and handling exceptions, ensuring your server remains reliable under pressure.

To further accelerate your workflow, Emberwhisk is paired with WAND, a development toolkit. WAND provides a rich command-line interface for debugging and managing your server without ever leaving your terminal.
